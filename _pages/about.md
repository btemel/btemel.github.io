Hi, this is my home on the web! I'm a graduate data science student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/). I'm interested in machine learning algorithms, computational social science and optimization. I'm working with [Onur Varol, Ph.D](http://www.onurvarol.com/) at [Viral Lab](http://varollab.com/). My current research focuses on Detecting anomalous followers on social networks. 

I received my undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering from Sabanci University. My graduation project aims to assess the costs and benefits of vehicle electrification in Istanbul. We approach the problem from a Multicriteria Decision Analysis perspective with conducting literature survey, study global examples, interviews with relevant parties, data collection and analysis. (Sabancı University 17’)
