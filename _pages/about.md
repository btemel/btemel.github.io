Hi, this is my home on the web! I'm a graduate data science student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/). I'm interested in machine learning algorithms, computational social science and optimization. I'm working with [Onur Varol, Ph.D](http://www.onurvarol.com/) at [Viral Lab](http://varollab.com/). My current research focuses on understanding the relation between exercise and well-being using Twitter data.

I received my undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering from Sabanci University. My graduation project was to develop an offer optimization model that will increase returns on sales through personalized campaigns by using different data mining techniques for a retail company in Turkey.
